## Abstract
Recently, saliency detection is an active topic in the multimedia field. Several algorithms have been proposed in this field. However, for some complex situations which contain multiple objects or complex background, they are not robust and their performances are not satisfied. In this paper, we introduce an innovative framework to improve the current saliency detection algorithms, in which we propose a new algorithm based on depth cue and an adaptive fusion mechanism. The proposed framework shows a good performance and maintains the robustness in complex situations. Experimentsâ€™ results show that the proposed framework is superior to other existing saliency approaches. Finally, we show a good application example by this framework to construct an image montage.
